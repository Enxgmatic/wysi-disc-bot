# Created on 10/02/2022<br>
My first bot.<br><br>

### Features
- Every time it is 7:27 (AM and PM), the bot will ping everyone. *(Is hard coded for utc+8)*
- Ping your friend and remind them every few hours that they have a skill issue!
- Get quick access to Aireu's black rover video and watch it to your heart's content
- Spam 727 quotes (and get banned in the process!)
- And as always, remember to let wysi bot know that they are a good or bad bot
<br><br>

### All commands
- $wysi good bot
- $wysi bad bot
- $wysi 727
- $wysi link
- $wysi skill issue *(just pings once)* <br>
<sub>The 727 alarm and the repeated skill issue alarm are automatic (but you need to specify the channel, as well as user in .env)</sub>
<br><br>

### Final words
This is a really shit bot. I coded it really poorly too.  
But it is a great way to annoy your friends so its 10/10.  
<sub>(Sincerely, please don't use this lmao)</sub>
